# About

I built this with a very basic understanding of local storage, JSON and JavaScript in general. I would like to come back and further build-out the app to integrate with apple calendar, google calendar & host a full year of editable dates, instead of just the current date.

# Usage

If you are a developer and open the console immediatly upon loading the page, you will get a TypeError @ line # script.js:78. It is cause of an empty array without current notes saved to local storage. I am still in the beginning stages of my career and plan to save everything to an object in future projects. This was the solution that I currently understand how to solve and still was tight with my deliverable time constraint.
